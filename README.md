# Customer-retention
In this project Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression machine learning models are used to predict the likelihood that each customer will become inactive and refrain from making any transactions for a period of 90 days (about 3 months) with the Sasol company.

The data preprocessing phase involved handling missing values and applying techniques like normalization and encoding to optimize the dataset for modeling. 

The findings demonstrate that these models are moderate effective tools for identifying customers who are at risk of being inactive, enabling the company to implement timely strategies for retention. It is important to note that the analysis highlighted key factors influencing customer loyalty, such as the frequency of top pack package activation, data usage volume, on-net call frequency, and customer activity over a three-month span. This information is invaluable for Sasol company in understanding and enhancing customer retention strategies. The results could have substantial implications in customer relationship management, particularly in designing targeted strategies for customer engagement and retention. By understanding key predictors of inactivity, Sasol company can develop more personalized, effective approaches to maintain customer engagement
